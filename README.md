# Carcass
Carcass is a basic programming language that's suppost to simple for beginners and not that hard on the person writing a program in it.
It was made using the Yoakke Lexer/Parser generator and some intense feelings.
If you'll be using the Carcass programming language for your project, please email me with your project, as I'm interested in seeing it!
If I do see your email, I will surely reply.

# How to Build?
To build Carcass you just need to clone the repository and well run ``dotnet build``.
It's as simple as that.

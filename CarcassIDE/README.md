# CarcassIDE

CarcassIDE is a lightweight integrated development environment that includes a small texteditor with the CarcassI.
To have CarcassI, if you build from source you'll have to probably copy the CarcassI executable, and the rest of it's dlls into the build of it.

CarcassIDE is currently Windows-only, however I have plans of porting it to use through Mono.

You can install the full CarcassIDE from the website.
